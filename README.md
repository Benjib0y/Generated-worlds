# Generated-worlds
A collection of RPGWorld Terrain editors and sample terrains procedurally generated - free to use.
The first editor is RPGWImportMap. It is a heightmap importer. 
Download the zip file and unpack it to your RPGWorld user folder. There are some sample heightmaps included for you to experiment with. You'll probably want to send a shortcut for the .exe to your desktop for simplicity of use.

The heightmaps must be 513x513 pixel greyscale .bmp images. Use your favourite picture editor and save the file to your RPGWorld user folder.

Have fun :)
